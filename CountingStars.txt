Counting Stars
One Republic
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars

I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face these flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
The old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie

Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is a four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie

Everything that drowns me makes me want to fly

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been thinking hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink it in the river
The lessons are learnt
